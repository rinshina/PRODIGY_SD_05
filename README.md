Web Scraping

Overview and Requirements
The program will:

Scrape product information such as names, prices, and ratings from an e-commerce website.
Store the scraped data in a structured format, such as a CSV file.
Handle various aspects of web scraping, including making HTTP requests, parsing HTML content, and handling pagination.
Choosing a Website
Select an e-commerce website that allows web scraping. Examples include:

Amazon
eBay
Walmart
Ensure you comply with the website's terms of service regarding scraping. 3. Libraries and Tools

To implement the program, you'll need the following Python libraries:

requests for making HTTP requests.
BeautifulSoup from bs4 for parsing HTML content.
csv for writing data to CSV files.
Steps for Implementation Step 1: Identify the Target Website and Analyze its Structure

Inspect the website's HTML to locate the elements containing the product name, price, and rating. Identify how the product listings are structured and determine how to navigate through multiple pages (pagination).

Step 2: Make HTTP Requests

Use the requests library to send GET requests to the website's URLs containing product listings.
Step 3: Parse HTML Content

Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content returned by the HTTP requests.
Extract the relevant data (product name, price, and rating) from the HTML.
Step 4: Handle Pagination

Identify the pattern used for pagination (e.g., a "Next" button or incrementing page numbers in the URL).
Loop through the pages to extract product data from each page.
Step 5: Store Data in a CSV File

Use the csv library to write the extracted product data into a CSV file with appropriate headers.
